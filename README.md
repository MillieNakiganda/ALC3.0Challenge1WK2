Write a javascript program that prompts a user to enter the user's year of birth and
in turn prints a string in the console stating whether the user is a minor, a youth or
an elder. Anyone below 18 years is a minor, anyone between 18 and 36 years of
age is a youth and the rest are elders.

Objects
Write a Javascript program that returns an object where the property names are
numbers between 1 and 15 and the values are squares of the names. Please note
that you should not hard code the object, and Test Driven Development(TDD) is
optional but highly encouraged.
